On the 20th of April session, [Jack](mailto:jack.hatfield12@imperial.ac.uk) showed us how how to create easy analysis pipelines for both ArcGIS and GIS in R.

[ModelBuilder](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/analyze/modelbuilder/what-is-modelbuilder.htm) in ArcGIS is an efficient way to queue processes as well as iterating over objects and files. Models can be saved in a toolbox and used again later or applied to new data. They can also be converted into ArcPy scripts.

QGIS has graphical modeller which is extremely similar.

GIS processes can also be carried out in R. See [this script](https://github.com/SilwoodComputerSkillz/SilwoodComputerSkillz.github.io/blob/master/scripts/RGISrains-Jack.R) for an example.
