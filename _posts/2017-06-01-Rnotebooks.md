On the 1st of June session, [Natalie](http://nhcooper123.github.io/) showed how to use `R markdown` to use `R studio` like a pro!

This was a nice follow up to [last session on Markdown](https://silwoodcomputerskillz.github.io/Markdown/).
In fact, Natalie showed us how to use markdown in R studio in order to write a complete notebook using [R notebooks](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html).
You can see her [cool entire module](https://rawgit.com/nhcooper123/macro-methods-module/master/MacroModule/_book/index.html) written all in markdown as a book (with chapters and everything).
For more details, have a look at [her repository](https://github.com/nhcooper123/macro-methods-module) that has all the nuts and bolts (don't hesitate to clone/modify!).
