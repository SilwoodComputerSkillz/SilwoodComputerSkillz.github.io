On the 16th of March session, [Samraat](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/s.pawar) made a nice and easy demo of how to use Jupyter and integrate it into collaborative workflows.

Check Jupyter [here](http://jupyter.org/) and check Samraat's example [here](https://github.com/SilwoodComputerSkillz/SilwoodComputerSkillz.github.io/blob/master/scripts/Jupyter-Samraat.ipynb) (running smoothly on GitHub!).
