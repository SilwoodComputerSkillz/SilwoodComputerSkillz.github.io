title: Open Tree of Life
---

On the 30th of March, [Dimitris](https://github.com/dgkontopoulos) showed us how to use the Open Tree of Life in a R pipeline.
Great stuff for phylo analysis (especially for getting backbones or constraints)!

Check the Open Tree of Life project [here](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/) and check Dimitris' example [here](https://github.com/SilwoodComputerSkillz/SilwoodComputerSkillz.github.io/blob/master/scripts/OTL-Dimitris.ipynb) (running smoothly on GitHub!).
