On the 27th of July session, [Thomas](http://tguillerme.github.io) had a go at showing how easy it is to wrap up your code into R packages using [devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html).

You can find the step by step recipe [here](https://github.com/TGuillermeTeaching/fakeR/blob/master/doc/making_R_packages.Rmd) and the full "package" [here](https://github.com/TGuillermeTeaching/fakeR).
It takes less than 10 minutes to get on track, have a go at it!
