On the 13th of July session, [Richard](https://github.com/rpdearden) demonstrated [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) - a completely free vector graphics software that can be used as an alternative to paid programs like Illustrator.

Inkscape is reasonably easy to use and has a wide range of capabilities - I use it to make posters and figures.  It is also good for converting images from raster to vector format.

In the session I essentially just ran through its basics, with examples.  An introduction can be found [here](https://github.com/rpdearden/Miscellany/blob/master/How-to/Inkscape.md).

The best way to learn it however is to play around. Answers to almost any Inkscape question you might have can be find by googling it - the program has been around for a while and is very well documented.
