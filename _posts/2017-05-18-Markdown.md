On the 18th of May session, I ([Thomas](http://tguillerme.github.io/)) showed how markdown is the answer to everything if you want to write down things.

Markdown is a really easy to use language.
You can find details on it's syntax on over here: [Daring Fireball Dingus](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus).

One of the major advantage though is that you can use it as a portable writing format and convert it into any kind of language using [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/).
Check out this [PeerJ paper](https://peerj.com/articles/cs-112/) for more details.

Finally you can also use Markdown for your normal coding via [knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/) in `R` or Rstudio...
